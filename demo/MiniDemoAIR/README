Note that you need AIR SDK, not Flex SDK to build this.

Example `build.properties` for a regular build
----------------------------------------------

    adt.store.type = pkcs12
    adt.store.path = SigningCert.p12
    adt.store.pass = 12345

How to generate cert (for testing purposes only):

    $ adt -certificate -cn SelfSign 2048-RSA SigningCert.p12 12345

Make sure that you know what are you doing if you're to release
the resulting app. Consult Adobe docs for details.
