Note that you need AIR SDK, not Flex SDK to build this.

Example `build.properties` for a regular build
----------------------------------------------

    adt.store.type = pkcs12
    adt.store.path = SigningCert.p12
    adt.store.pass = 12345

How to generate cert (for testing purposes only):

    $ adt -certificate -cn SelfSign 2048-RSA SigningCert.p12 12345

Make sure that you know what are you doing if you're to release
the resulting app. Consult Adobe docs for details.

Hints on configuration for iOS build
------------------------------------

Note: Due to many complications like developer licenses, provisioning files
etc., it is too much work to streamline the iOS build of this small demo
so it works out of the box. Patches are welcome. Meanwhile, consult Apple
and Adobe documentation for instructions on how to set up the basic stuff
for your application.

Here is an example of `build.properties` to get an .ipa for testing purposes:

    adt.iphone.target = ipa-test
    adt.iphone.provisioning-profile = iOS.mobileprovision
    adt.iphone.store.path = MyiPhoneDevelperCertificate.p12
    adt.iphone.store.password = 12345
    adt.out.file.ext = ipa

For remote debugging, configure this with your machine IP:

    adt.iphone.remdebug.ip = 192.168.1.2

Append this to the above `adt.store` stuff. Note that you need to use your
Apple-issued certificate, exported to `.p12` for `adt.iphone.store.path`,
not a self-signed one.

Build as follows:

    $ ant # to build prerequisites
    $ ant package.iphone

Run this instead of the last line for remote debugging:

    $ ant package.iphone-remdebug

To run remote debugger without FDT:

    $ fdb
    (fdb) run

Make sure the debugger is running and says `Waiting for Player to connect`
before you start the application. See Adobe docs for more information
on using the debugger.
